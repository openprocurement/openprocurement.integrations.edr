Basic request
-------------

In order to get information from EDR by code EDRPOU you need to make a request to `api/1.0/verify` endpoint, passing code as GET parameter:

.. include:: tutorial/basic_request.http
   :code:
Response consists of the following fields: `x_edrInternalId`, `registrationStatusDetails`, `registrationStatus`, `identification.schema`, `identification.id`, `identification.legalName`, `identification.url`.

* `x_edrInternalId` - unique identification of the subject,
* `registrationStatusDetails` - text state of the entity (uk),
* `registrationStatus` - text state of the entity,
* `identification.schema` - “UA-EDR”
* `identification.id` - EDRPOU; if the subject - an individual entrepreneur - instead of IPN system returns ten zeros, because the data is confidential,
* `identification.legalName` -  name of the entity,
* `identification.url` - link to the entity with detailed information.

.. include:: tutorial/ipn.http
   :code:
